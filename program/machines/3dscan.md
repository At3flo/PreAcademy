* [3D Scanning](#3d-scanning)
  * [Individual assignment](#individual-assignment)
  * [Extra assignments](#extra-assignments)

## General Notes

* File limit set to 1 Mb per file. Check file sizes `du -s * | sort -rn` 1-2 Mb week
* Clean up the archive (remove old unused students folders and files)
* Whatever you 3D print, it must be your own design. It cannot be just downloaded. You can modify other's design though, give credits in this case.

## 3D Scanning

### Individual assignment

Scan something using:

* Camera Pictures
* Xbox Kinect
* Structured light
* Roland Modella (windows). Scan something that you cannot scan with this level of detail (like a coin) or not possible at all like Glass.

### Extra assignments

Since these are not mandatory you can do and document them in group.

* Learn how to edit and fix STL files
* Try to 3D print your scan
* Try make your own scanner DIY (milk scanner, laser scanner, ...)
