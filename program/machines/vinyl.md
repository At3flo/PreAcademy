## General tips

These are general tips, not only for successfully completing the assignment, but also for learning in-depth some important concepts. During this week you will use 2D design software for computer controlled cutting applications and the basics of the vinyl and laser cutter.

* This week, spiral development is specially useful for the press-fit design.
* Nesting. Learn how to nest manually and also try tools for nesting like [SVGnest](https://github.com/Jack000/SVGnest).
* Did I ever mention _document as you work_?

## Vinyl Cutter

* At the bare minimum learn how to use the machine and **design and fabricate** at least a sticker. (Note the design word, it must be your own design)
* You can start something designed by other. But this does not count towards the assignment.
* Try fab modules and the machine driver. What do you like more?

Going beyond:

* Create a small sticker. What is the smallest shape you can cut?
* Create a big sticker. What happens when static electricity comes into the equation?
* Create a multilayer sticker. Learn how to align the layers.
* Cut a circuit board in copper. That requires [some tricks](http://fab.cba.mit.edu/content/processes/PCB/vinylcut.html).

## Press-fit laser cut design

Use a parametric tool to **design** a press-fit construction set and lasercut it in cardboard. Can either be a modular construction set or [sliced object](http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.12/people/dsawada/w2.html).

Going beyond:

* Try raster engraving. Experiment with different values of power and speed.
* Try to find the limit resolution of the machine.
* Try to find the **kerf** of the machine. What is the kerf by the way?
* Compare fab modules with the laser driver provided by the manufacturer.
* Try the Javascript fab modules halftone cuts (not in cardboard).
* Experiment with flexures.
