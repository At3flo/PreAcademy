## Educational programs: The Academany

![](./img/intro/academany.png)

The Academany a short name for **The Academy of Almost Anything**, a new global educational structure offering high level education all over the globe, at connected sites offering the same infrastructure to all students. All courses that are part of The Academy of Almost Anything are **directed by people leading the way in their field**, and constantly evolve to stay at the cutting edge development of research into tools, technologies and techniques.

### Academany methodology

Academany programs are not a traditional but a **distributed education system** with mentors instead of teachers. Students undertake their own research in a 5 months long program. Academany educational programs are inline with [the nine principles](http://media.mit.edu/about/principles) from Joi Ito (MIT Media Lab).

### How Fab Academy works

* Every week a different topic.
* Basic principle is **Learn + make + share**. Based in the Scientific method
  * Learn: Weekly class by Neil Gershenfeld (MIT) by videoconferencing system. Student undertakes its own research
  * Make: Hands-on with local instructor guidance to complete an assignment. Is an iterative approach strategy where time management is crucial
  * Share: Student documents the experience through a personal portfolio
* 3 levels of assessment
  * Student self-assessment: Student checks its progress against the [Assignments and Assessments](http://docs.academany.org/FabAcademy-Assessment/_book/) document.
  * Local evaluation: Local instructors make sure you meet the required standard
  * Global Evaluation: Completing students go through global evaluation process
* Graduation: Diploma vs Learning
* Links to previous years archives and important docs
  * [Archives](http://archive.fabacademy.org)

  * You design a (beautiful) 1280x720 pixels `.png` presentation slide
  * You create a 30s compressed 720p `.mp4` presentation video introducing you and your final project

### A piece of advice

* Do not follow existing roads, make your own path

> **Learning by doing:** Backup your data, partition your hard drive and install Ubuntu-based distro in it

### Create online accounts

It is recommended that students create the following online accounts:

* [Fablabs.io](fablabs.io) account. This is the official account used for many services
* [Google](google.com) account for all Google services (YouTube...)
* [Vimeo](vimeo.com) account for storing large videos. Alternative to Youtube.
* [Github](github.com) account for your personal code projects
* [Dropbox](dropbox.com) or similar account for hosting large files
* [Sketchfab](sketchfab.com) account for embedding and hosting STL files
