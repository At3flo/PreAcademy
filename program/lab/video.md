## AV Configuration

At the top right corner there is a **settings** button where you can select the camera and microphone you will be using as well as the speakers.

## Muting and unmuting

**Before** you enter the videoconference, always remember to mute **locally**. That way your microphone does not send audio to the server. Remember also to mute locally when you are not talking.

> Exercise: Looking at your system settings/sound/input panel, find your mute/unmute key and practice muting and unmuting locally.

By default, **you are also muted in the room**.  That is a second layer mute for people who constantly forgets to mute locally. After you make sure you are muted locally, make sure you are also unmuted on the room.

> Exercise: Connect to videoconference. Make sure you are muted locally. Talk to someone and practice muting locally when you are not talking.

## Modifying the layout

You can modify the layout (size of the video vs size of the presentation) using the slider.

> Exercise: Connect to videoconference and practice modifying the layout screen.

## Create your own videoconference

For your personal or group meetings you can connect to a similar service as BlueJeans called https://meet.jit.si/
