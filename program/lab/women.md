Look carefully at the following data:

| fabzero edition          | Men | Women |
| ------------------------ | --- | ----- |
| Preacademy 2015 Kerala, India    | 20  | 2     |
| Preacademy 2016 Kerala, India    | 19  | 2     |
| Preacademy 2017 Amman, Jordan   | 5   | 1     |
| Fabzero 2019 Bubhaneswar, India | 23   | 0     |
| Fabzero 2019 Cairo, Egypt    | 13   | 1     |

This are the men and women enrolled in the past editions of fabzero (formerly preacademy). This is not an isolated case. **Women remain significantly underrrepresented in tech and science.**
